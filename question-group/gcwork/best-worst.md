# What are the best/worst parts of your job?

## Best
For me, the best parts are always the people. I've gotten to work with some wonderful staff in different jobs and the patients are usually lovely people.

## Not Great
The worst parts for me are repetition. There can be some tedious and repetitive tasks around documentation, so I try to look for ways to automate what I can.
